# 🧪 QA Portfolio – Manual and Automation Software Testing

Welcome to my QA portfolio! I'm an aspiring **QA Tester** focused on **manual testing** with a growing foundation in **automation**. I'm also preparing for a future in **Cybersecurity (Blue Team/Defensive Security)**.

This repository showcases my skills in testing software, automating tasks, and creating test web apps for hands-on practice.

## 🧪 Automation Tests

This section includes automated test scripts written in Python using Selenium.

### `test_valid_login_with_brave.py`
- Automates a valid login scenario on [Practice Test Automation Login Page](https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/)
- Uses the Brave browser via Selenium WebDriver
- Helps validate that the login functionality is working correctly for correct credentials

### `test_invalid_login_with_brave.py`
- Automates an invalid login scenario to test error handling
- Uses the Brave browser via Selenium WebDriver
- Ensures that the web app correctly displays error messages for invalid login attempts

### `test_form_submission_with_brave.py`
- Automates form submission testing on a demo form
- Verifies successful submission and checks for success/error messages

---

## 📁 Test Web App

To support testing practices, I have created a small test web app located in the `test-web-app` folder. The app includes:

- **index.html** — The main page of the app.
- **login.html** — A login page that can be tested for both valid and invalid login scenarios.
- **styles.css** — The stylesheet to provide basic design for the pages.
- **scripts.js** — JavaScript for client-side form validation and interactions.

This web app is used for both **manual testing** and **automated testing** as part of my learning and portfolio.

## 💼 About Me

I'm transitioning into tech from a non-technical background and actively working toward:
- Entry-level Manual QA Tester roles (Remote preferred)
- Growing familiarity with tools like Jira, TestRail, GitHub, Selenium (basic)
- Cybersecurity (Blue Team) training in the background
